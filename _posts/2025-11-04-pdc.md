## Summary & Contribution

* We introduce **probability distribution collapse** as a bottleneck to inducing more compact grammars in an unsupervised setting.

* We investigate its causes within neural parameterization and propose a simple, yet effective solution, termed **collapse-relaxing neural parameterization**.

* We provide extensive validation of our approach, demonstrating improvements in both upper bound and practical accuracy, as well as grammar compactness, on constituent parsing tasks for English and multilingual benchmarks.
